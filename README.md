## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps
This completes Task 2.1 (HTML pages). The next phase would involve:

- Implementing the chosen logo
- Adding actual product images
- Enhancing the styling with the client's brand colors

## Notes
- All pages follow the wireframe specifications exactly
- No colors have been applied yet (as per requirements)
- Placeholder images are referenced but not included
- Form functionality would need backend implementation
- Shopping cart functionality would need JavaScript implementation
